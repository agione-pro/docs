## Version and Dependency Requirements (Example)

- Use validated driver version combinations
- Container runtime and GPU plugins must match kernel/driver compatibility
- In multi-node clusters, standardize driver versions across nodes

## Known Limitations (Example)

- Some legacy GPUs may be unstable under long-context inference workloads
- Mixed-chip clusters may be constrained by low-level driver compatibility for cross-node scheduling
- Some models may require chip-specific operators or conversion flows

## Evaluation Recommendations

- Run a 24-hour stability stress test before production go-live
- Benchmark key models per chip type as a baseline
- For non-recommended models, run PoC validation before production deployment
