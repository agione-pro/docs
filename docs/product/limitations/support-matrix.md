# AGIOne Product Support Matrix and Known Limitations

## 1. Document Overview

This document specifies AGIOne's current product support scope, deployment environments, managed compute nodes, managed compute platforms, model capabilities, on-premises rapid-deployment model catalog, and known limitations.

This document constitutes a draft support matrix, applicable to product introductions, presales proposals, delivery assessments, and pre-deployment technical confirmations. Prior to actual project delivery, the final support scope should be confirmed by referencing the official release notes, delivery package compatibility matrix, driver versions, inference engine versions, and on-site environment assessment results.

## 2. Overall Support Scope

| Management Node Deployment | Supports All-in-One, local multi-node, Kubernetes/cloud-native, private deployment, and offline or low-connectivity delivery | Specific specifications must be confirmed based on deployment form, managed scale, and delivery package version |
| Compute Node Management | Supports NVIDIA Hopper / Ampere / Ada, Ascend 910B/910C, Enflame 106, Biren S60 | Chip manageability does not imply that all model, driver, CUDA, and inference engine combinations have been validated |

## 11. Deployment and Runtime Constraints

| Constraint | Description | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Management and compute node roles are distinct | Management nodes do not require GPU/XPU; compute nodes require at least 1 XPU/GPU/NPU | Clearly define management plane and compute plane boundaries in deployment design |
| Resource specifications have multiple interpretations | All-in-One recommendation is 8C/16GiB/200GiB; production management node requirements can reach >=16C/>=16GiB with a minimum of 3 nodes | Differentiate between All-in-One, host-mode multi-node, and production management plane by deployment form |
| Port entry points have multiple interpretations | Ports such as `443`, `18090`, `80`, `8089` appear in the documentation | Distinguish between external HTTPS entry, portal/API entry, Nginx entry, and job access proxy entry |
| Offline delivery depends on complete packages | Missing bundle, images, offline Python, checksum, or Docker/Compose resources will block deployment | Execute integrity verification of delivery artifacts before deployment |
| Homogeneous architecture is preferred | The same Kubernetes cluster is recommended to manage identical CPU architectures | Heterogeneous CPU architectures should be split across clusters or resource pools |
| Time synchronization requirements | Multi-node deployments require NTP or equivalent time synchronization | Clock skew should preferably be kept within 1 second |
| Production resource headroom | High-concurrency and core business workloads require reserved resource headroom | Production deployments should reserve 20%–30% resource headroom |

## 12. Model Deployment Constraints

| Constraint | Description | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chip compatibility does not equal model validation | Support for chip management does not imply that all models, inference engines, and quantization schemes for that chip have been validated | Establish a model-chip-driver-inference engine validation matrix |
| Ultra-large models have high resource thresholds | Models such as qwen3.5-397b, qwen3-235b, DeepSeek-V3 require high VRAM, multi-GPU, or parallelism strategies | Evaluate VRAM, card count, parallelism, KV Cache, context length, and throughput before deployment |
| Multimodal and OCR depend on additional pipelines | Vision models and OCR models depend on image preprocessing, model images, and inference framework support | Separately validate end-to-end pipelines by model type |
| Embedding / Reranker affect RAG latency | Adding vectorization and reranking increases chain latency | Conduct separate stress testing on RAG scenarios for recall quality, latency, and concurrency |
| Reasoning models have higher consumption | Thinking models typically produce longer outputs with higher latency and token consumption | Configure separate rate limiting, quota, and cost policies |
| Aggregate model capabilities must be aligned | Sub-models within an aggregate model may differ in context length, tool-calling ability, multimodal capability, pricing, and protocol support | Add capability constraints and degradation strategies to routing policies |

## 13. Network, Storage, and High-Availability Constraints

| Constraint | Description | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RDMA requirements vary by scenario | Single-GPU inference does not strictly require RDMA; multi-node, multi-GPU inference or training recommends 100 Gbps+ RDMA | Design network based on model scale, parallelism strategy, and throughput objectives |
| Shared storage depends on model scale | Model weights, images, logs, MinIO, databases, and middleware require persistent storage | Plan block storage, NAS, NFS, Ceph, or RWX storage in advance |
| Cloud-native deployment depends on StorageClass | Databases and middleware persistent volumes require RWO; some shared data requires RWX | Validate PVC creation, mounting, and backup recovery before deployment |
| Image registry must be reachable | Cloud-native deployment requires all nodes to have access to the image registry | Validate registry connectivity, authentication Secrets, and image pull in advance |
| Ingress / DNS / TLS affect accessibility | Cloud-native entry depends on domain resolution, certificates, and ingress controllers | Complete external access, internal resolution, and certificate validation before go-live |
| High availability requires multi-node design | Single-node deployment cannot provide full high availability | Production deployments should adopt multi-node management, database primary-standby, backup, and rollback mechanisms |

## 14. Pending Confirmation Items

| Pending Item | Current Status | Recommended Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CUDA version matrix | The current knowledge base does not declare a fixed CUDA version | Supplement the CUDA matrix based on delivery package, GPU driver, images, and inference engines |

| Ascend software stack versions | Currently only confirms Ascend 910B/910C support | Supplement CANN, MindIE, driver, and model adaptation versions |
| Model VRAM and card count requirements | The current catalog only lists model names | Supplement FP16/BF16/INT8/INT4, tensor parallelism, and minimum card counts by model scale |
| API protocol support scope | The white paper mentions OpenAI / Anthropic and other protocols | Confirm interface scope and field compatibility against the official product version |
| Port specifications | Multiple expressions such as `443`, `18090`, `80`, `8089` exist across documentation | Produce an official network port planning table
