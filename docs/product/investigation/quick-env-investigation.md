# Environment Quick Assessment

This document is used before AGIOne local deployment or cloud-native deployment to determine whether the environment meets installation prerequisites, identify delivery risks, and produce a remediation and go-live checklist.

## 1. Document Information

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Project | AGIOne Platform |
| Assessment Date | `<YYYY-MM-DD>` |
| Customer or Site | `<customer/site>` |
| Deployment Type | Local deployment; Cloud-native deployment |
| Environment Type | Development; Testing; Production |
| Assessor | `<name>` |
| Owner | `<name>` |
| Overall Verdict | Pass; Conditional Pass; Blocked |

## 2. Assessment Goals

- Confirm whether the target environment can install and run AGIOne.
- Identify risks before installation, especially resource, network, package, permission, storage, and operation risks.
- Produce a clear remediation list with owners and deadlines.
- Produce a go-live checklist for final installation approval.

## 3. Deployment Scope

| Scope | Local Deployment | Cloud-Native Deployment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime Model | Docker / Docker Compose on physical servers or VMs | Kubernetes, container registry, Ingress, storage, and platform components |
| Common Pattern | All-in-one single node; host-mode multi-node | Existing Kubernetes cluster; AGIOne-managed kube-cluster delivery |
| Minimum Node Count | Single-node: 1; host-mode multi-node: 4 | Based on cluster design and workload size |
| Main Verification | Host resources, SSH, Docker, offline bundle, ports, runtime directories | Kubernetes readiness, registry, StorageClass, Ingress, node resources, namespace permissions |

## 4. Quick Verdict Rules

| Verdict | Criteria | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pass | All critical prerequisites are satisfied and no blocking risks remain. | Proceed with installation approval. |
| Conditional Pass | Installation can proceed after controlled remediation or with accepted non-blocking risks. | Track open items in the remediation list and confirm risk acceptance. |
| Blocked | Any critical prerequisite is missing, such as insufficient nodes, unreachable SSH, missing bundle assets, unavailable storage, or conflicting network CIDR. | Stop installation until the blocking issue is fixed. |
